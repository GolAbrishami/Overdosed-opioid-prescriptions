# Overdose death caused by opioid prescription

The opioid is a class of drugs that include *illegal* drugs and pain relievers obtained by *legally prescription*.

According to the Center for Disease Control, the U.S is experiencing an epidemic of the drug overdose; however, the numbers of opioid prescriptions, the prescriptions that include illegal drugs, are not controlled. 
We have chosen a dataset to analyze the ***linear*** relationship between opioid prescriptions and the number of overdose death.

The project's dataset obtained from [Data World](https://data.world/health/opioid-overdose-deaths/workspace/project-summary).


| Column Name   | Type          | 
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| state         | string        | 
| year          | year          |
| deaths        | string        |
| population    | integer       |
| crude rate    | string        |
| crude rate lower 95 confidanece interval | string|
|crude rate upper 95 confidanece interval  | string|




## Outcome :

Data shows the crude rate of opioid overdose increased by the opiod persceription number, however, the impact is much more than what we are seeing in this research.
There are numbers of passions who become addicted to opioid and reach their opioid drugs from other resources other than legal prescriptions.
